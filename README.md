# Change_Detection_Algorithm

This project detects and highlights differences between **before-and-after images** of the same scene. It draws bounding boxes around the areas that have changed.

## Project Overview

- Detects missing or altered objects between two aligned images.
- Automatically processes image pairs in a folder.
- Saves the result as a modified "after" image with change areas highlighted in red boxes.
